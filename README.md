##
A key difference between relational databases like MySQL and non-relational databases like MOngoDB is how they store and organize data. As, Relatioal databases use structured tables with fixed schemas and relationss defined by primary and foreign keys, while MongoDB stores data inot flexible, JSON-like documenytts that can vary in strucutre. Thus, allowing MongoDB to handle unstructured or rapidly changing data more easily.
  In helathcare, MongoDB would be appropriate for storing electronic health records( EHRs) that include a wide variety of patient information such as demogrpahics, visit notes, lab resuts, and imaging reports. Due to, MongoDB's flexible schema it's bettter suited for storing patient's data which can differ. Thus, MongoDB would allow clincians and developers to store diverse data types effiecently and update records wihtout major schema changes.
